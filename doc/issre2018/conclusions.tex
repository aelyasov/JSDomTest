\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper we have introduced a novel JS unit testing framework, called \emph{JEDI}, which uses search-based techniques for generating test data. Notably, our testing framework is able to generate an arbitrary DOM input, which is syntactically valid and compliant with the recent HTML5 specification. We propose a novel test generation algorithm, called ``genetic with restart'', combining the benefits of systematic fitness improvement with the genetic search and the ability of escaping plateaus by restarting search with a new target. Based on the case studies found in two related works~\emph{Confix}~\cite{amin:ase15} and \emph{TAJS}~\cite{dom2011}, we conduced an empirical validation of our framework and performed a significance study of the results. The validation has shown the effectiveness of the framework in covering target branches with a reasonable efficiency.
